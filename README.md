# CSIT Interview Question

This readme will serve as my diary at attempting the CSIT Interview Question for the role of Cloud Engineer  

I will structure the readme in chronological order and try to work on the problem daily  

### 7 Nov 2024
Initialised git repo  
Added qn.txt and copied interview question  
Added jd.txt 

I have never done a design question before but I will attempt to do this with whatever knowledge I have acquired over my short two years as an engineer  

My initial thoughts are  
- Fulfil all infra related requirements 
    - Demonstrate a POC for solutions used
- To justify why a specific solution is used for a requirement, follow the framework
    - Assess business need
        - Does the solution do what is required by the business user
    - Technical requirements
        - Performance needs and ease of integration
    - Security and compliance
        - What are the layers to prevent access
    - Cost efficiency
        - Will the company be bankrupt
